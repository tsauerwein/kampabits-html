		<p>KampaBits has been training in ICT multimedia for 3 years and we have a good success rate in placing the youth that we train in jobs. We have our youth working in some web design companies in Kampala and elsewhere. Some of the examples include Netcom, Mountbatten, Techno brain, Fina Africa among others.</p>

		<p><strong>KampaBits trains in the following programs:</strong></p>

		<h2>ICT Multimedia</h2>

		<p>This is a very innovative ICT course which is implemented in four levels namely course one, two, three and media lab. The courses are progressive starting from introduction to computers up to specialization in ICT Web design and development. Media lab is the highest and the final level of training after which the graduates are linked to internship and employment opportunities in ICT related companies. We are currently improving our curriculum building a content management system to manage emergence of new trends and ease of access.</p>

		<h2>Micro-Entrepreneurship program</h2>

		<p>The multimedia course more often than not pushes youth to getting formal jobs. But in an effort to motivate youth to become entrepreneurs and take advantage of the opportunities that exist currently in the market; Kampabits also trains youth in entrepreneurship. This program enlightens the youths on business skills required to identify opportunities, start, run and grow businesses. By the end of the training, the youths acquire useful skills to run their own businesses.</p>
